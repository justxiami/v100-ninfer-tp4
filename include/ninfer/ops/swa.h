 * The fixed geometry is D=128, Hq=32, Hkv=8, group=4, and window W=2048 or 4096.
 * q/out are contiguous BF16 [128,32,T,B], query_k/query_v are contiguous BF16 [128,8,T,B],
 * positions is contiguous device I32 [T,B], valid_columns and lanes are contiguous device I32
 * [B]. Row b has V=valid_columns[b] live query columns with positions[i,b]=L[b]+i for i<V;
 * lanes[b] selects its cyclic-cache lane. Columns i>=V are an inert physical tail and produce
 * zero output.
 *
 * The read-only cyclic context contains committed absolute positions [max(0,L-W),L), with
 * absolute position p stored at physical slot p mod W. Query K/V is a separate temporary
 * segment at positions [L,L+V). For every live query position p_i, admitted populated keys satisfy
 * abs(p_j-p_i)<W. Thus distance W-1 is included, distance W is excluded, and every query
 * row sees every live temporary query row from the same batch row. scale is 1/sqrt(128).
 *
 * Context and query K/V are unchanged. out is the only observable mutation and is completely
 * overwritten. The supported domain is T=1..16, B=1..8 on the built CUDA target.
 *
 * The caller guarantees min_context <= L <= max_context, sequential nonnegative positions, and
 * that the cyclic context contains the declared live interval. The execution envelope may affect
 * finite launch selection and workspace capacity, never the admitted key set.
